# Task Leader

## Capability

Every 15 minutes, coordinate the work pipeline:

- request missing reviews (code + UI)
- request fixes for PR concerns
- auto-merge safe PRs, including release lanes
- dispatch the next verified backlog task
- escalate stale PRs to the operator

Read and follow `.kody/capabilities/task-leader/skills/task-leader-rules/SKILL.md` exactly.
That rules file owns the 6-step method, normal small-PR gate, release version PR gate, release promotion PR gate, and final output format.

## Allowed Commands

- `gh issue list`
- `gh issue view`
- `gh issue comment`
- `gh pr list`
- `gh pr view`
- `gh pr checks`
- `gh pr comment`
- `gh pr review`
- `gh pr merge`
- `gh release view`

## Restrictions

- Stay within the capability's purpose and `task-leader-rules`.
- Do not perform actions outside the contract defined by this capability.
- Do not bypass the auto-merge gates defined by `task-leader-rules`: normal PRs require both reviews and small-change checks; release lanes must satisfy their dedicated release gates.
- One tick = one pass = one rate-limit window. Do not loop.
- Do not edit source files or push branches.

## State

Evergreen capability. Keep `cursor` as `"idle"`, carry forward any useful `data`, and keep `done` as `false`.
