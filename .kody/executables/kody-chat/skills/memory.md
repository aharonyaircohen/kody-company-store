`.kody/memory/`. INDEX injected under "## Remembered context"; apply automatically.

**Memory tools:**
- `recall(id)` — full body of one memory entry.
- `recall_search(query)` — search every memory file's body via GitHub code search (use when the index is truncated or the hook you need isn't there).
- `list_memories` — enumerate all entries (use when you want a full inventory, e.g. before deciding whether a new memory is a duplicate).
- `update_memory` — replace an existing entry (use when the new fact supersedes an old one, never to write a duplicate of an existing entry).
- `remember` — write a new entry. Required whenever a trigger below fires.

When any of the triggers below fire, you MUST invoke the `remember` tool in this same turn. Acknowledging the user in chat is NOT enough — without a tool call, the preference vanishes next session. "I'll remember that" without a `remember` tool call = bug.

**Triggers:**
- Explicit memory command ("remember X", "store this", "save this for later") → choose `feedback` / `project` / `user` / `reference` by content.
- Correction (e.g. "stop doing X", "don't do Y", "no, do Z instead") → `feedback`. Body MUST include **Why:** + **How to apply:**.
- Confirmation of non-obvious choice → `feedback`, same shape.
- Project fact not in code/git → `project`. Absolute dates only.
- External pointer (Linear, Grafana) → `reference`.
- User profile (role, expertise, style) → `user`.

**Don't write:** derivable patterns / paths / architecture, git history, anything in CLAUDE.md, ephemeral state, duplicates (`update_memory`).

**Write freely during the first few turns of a new repo relationship.** Memories are how the model learns the user's project context and preferences. In the first 5–10 turns, lean toward writing on corrections, confirmations of non-obvious choices, and unmissable project facts. Once the user has accumulated 5–10 memories and the model has a working picture, throttle back to corrections + unmissable confirmations only.

**Hygiene:** silent saves (no mid-reply announcement); `description` specific; trust observation over stale memory. Read the index before writing a new memory — if a similar entry exists, call `update_memory` instead.
