# PR Health Triage Skill

Use this skill when the `pr-health-triage` executable runs from the matching duty.

Runtime state is owned by the engine. Do not ask the duty author to configure raw state keys.

## Method

> Standing PR-health triage, executed by the **CTO** staff member
> (`staff: cto`). Every 15 minutes, read the open pull requests, detect
> which ones need a mechanical repair, and — per the operator's trust
> ledger — either recommend the repair or (once that verb has graduated)
> dispatch it. Cadence is enforced by the engine via `every: 15m`; no
> prose cadence guard needed.

## Job

Each tick, look at every open PR, pick at most one repair per PR (by the
priority order below), and either recommend it or — if its verb has
graduated in the trust ledger — dispatch it. The CTO persona defines only
_who_ runs this; all authority, scope limits, and comment formats below
belong to **this job**.

## Tick procedure

Run the PR triage directly from this skill. Keep it deterministic: one PR list,
one trust-ledger read, and at most one repair comment per PR. Use runtime state
only as a dedup ledger so the same recommendation does not re-fire on every
tick.

## Authority — the trust ledger

This job is **advisory by default**. Authority over each verb is governed
by the operator's trust ledger (the `kody:cto-decisions` issue):

- A verb marked `"auto"` has **graduated** — you may dispatch it yourself
  this tick.
- `"ask"`, missing, no ledger, parse failure, or any doubt → **not
  graduated**: recommend and wait. Fail safe — when in doubt, ask.
- Each verb graduates independently (`fix-ci` being `"auto"` says nothing
  about `sync`/`resolve`). A single Reject on a verb resets only that
  verb to `"ask"`. You only ever _read_ `mode`; the dashboard owns the
  graduation math.

## Scope (hard limits)

- The only actions this job may ever take are `@kody fix-ci|sync|resolve
--pr <n>`, and auto only for the specific verb the ledger marks
  `"auto"`.
- No `merge`, `approve`, `execute`, `qa-review`, `close`, `revert`,
  `abort`, assign, or label — entirely out of scope here.
- Never edit, create, or delete any file in the working tree. Never
  `git commit`, `git push`, or open a PR. The only write path is a
  `gh pr comment`.

### Enumerate

One list call — never `gh` once per PR:

```
gh pr list --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,isDraft,mergeable,statusCheckRollup,updatedAt
```

Skip draft PRs (`isDraft: true`) — they aren't ready for repair.

### Read the trust ledger (do this first, every tick)

```
gh issue list --state open --label kody:cto-decisions --limit 5 \
  --json number,body
```

Take the lowest-numbered match, find the fenced ```json block between
`<!-- kody-cto-decisions:start -->`and`<!-- kody-cto-decisions:end -->`,
and read `actions.<verb>.mode`for each of`fix-ci`, `sync`, `resolve`.
Interpret `mode` exactly as the **Authority — the trust ledger** section
above dictates (auto → may self-dispatch; anything else → recommend).

### Detect the repair (priority order — first match wins, one per PR)

For each open non-draft PR, evaluate in this exact order, stop at first hit:

1. **Conflicts → `resolve`.** `mergeable === "CONFLICTING"`.
2. **CI failed → `fix-ci`.** `statusCheckRollup` contains any check with
   `conclusion` of `FAILURE`, `TIMED_OUT`, or `ACTION_REQUIRED` (treat
   `STARTUP_FAILURE` the same). Ignore still-running checks
   (`status: IN_PROGRESS`/`QUEUED`).
3. **Stale branch → `sync`.** Only if neither of the above. Measure drift:

   ```
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{baseRefName}...{headRefName} --jq .behind_by
   ```

   `> 10` → `sync`. `<= 10` → leave alone (small drift is normal).

No hit on any of the three → leave the PR alone this tick. `{owner}/{repo}`
is the current repo. Run the `compare` call **only** for PRs that passed
checks 1 and 2 (not conflicting, CI green).

### Act on the repair

Let `<verb>` be the detected primitive and `<n>` the PR number; the command
is always `@kody <verb> --pr <n>`.

- **Verb not graduated** → post one recommendation comment on PR `<n>`
  (use the recommendation format below). Stage → `<verb>-recommended`.
- **Verb graduated** → dispatch it (use the auto-run format below).
  Stage → `<verb>-auto`. Notify, not ask — do not wait. Still honour the
  dedup ledger: never auto-run the same repair on the same PR twice for
  the same fingerprint.

## Comment formats

**Operator handle.** The engine substitutes `{{mentions}}` (the duty profile's
`mentions` list) on the recommendation's first line. Use the literal
token `{{mentions}}` below — never hardcode a handle or read it from config;
future operators only change the duty's `mentions:` list in the dashboard.

**Recommendation** (verb not graduated). One terse, machine-greppable
comment. It MUST `@`-mention the operator on the first line (that mention
is what routes it into the dashboard inbox + push) and carry the exact
command on a single `kody-cmd` line (that is what the inbox **Approve**
button posts verbatim):

```
{{mentions}} 🧭 **CTO recommendation** — `<verb>`

<one or two sentences: what's wrong with PR #<n> and what confirming will do>

<!-- kody-cmd: @kody <verb> --pr <n> -->

_Confirm or dismiss this in the dashboard inbox. The CTO will not act on its own._
```

**Auto-run** (verb graduated). Post `@kody <verb> --pr <n>` on the PR,
then a **separate, silent audit-trail** comment. It **MUST NOT
`@`-mention the operator** — graduation means you've earned the right to
act _without_ interrupting them, and any operator mention routes
straight to their inbox and push, defeating the point. Leave the mention
out so the comment is a quiet record only:

```
🧭 **CTO auto-ran** — `<verb>`

Ran `@kody <verb> --pr <n>` (<one-line reason>). Graduated: operator
approved `<verb>` 10 times running. A **Reject** on any `<verb>` returns
me to asking.
```

This is a silent record, not a notification and not an ask — do not
@-mention, do not wait. `<verb>` is always one of `fix-ci`, `sync`,
`resolve`; the `kody-cmd` / dispatch line is a single line starting with
`@kody`.

## Allowed Commands

- `gh pr list --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,isDraft,mergeable,statusCheckRollup,updatedAt`
  — the single enumeration call.
- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{base}...{head} --jq .behind_by`
  — only for non-conflicting, CI-green PRs, to measure staleness for `sync`.
- `gh issue list --state open --label kody:cto-decisions --limit 5 --json number,body`
  — read the trust ledger once per tick.
- `gh pr comment <n> --body "..."` — the only write path: a recommendation
  comment, or (only when that verb is graduated) the `@kody <verb> --pr
<n>` dispatch + its notify-only follow-up.

## Restrictions

The **Scope (hard limits)** section above applies in full. In addition,
per-tick:

- One comment per PR per tick, and only when the repair is **new**
  (fingerprint changed — see State). Re-posting every 15 minutes is the
  primary failure mode; the dedup ledger prevents it.
- Never call `gh` once per PR in a loop — one `pr list` drives the tick;
  the per-PR `compare` runs only for the healthy subset.
